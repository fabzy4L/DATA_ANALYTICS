timesxday<- (c(52, 52, 52, 52, 52, 53, 52))
#All days but Friday (53) occured 52 times. The expected probability can be calculated by dividing the number of times the day occured over the total number of days in a year. That'll tell us the distribution of probability of being born a particular day. 

expected.prob <- (timesxday/365)
expected.prob
```
```{r}
#Sum of Expected Probs
sum(expected.prob)
#the sum must equal 1
```
```{r}
#Expected Probability of births per day // proportional
B.prob <- expected.prob*350
B.prob
sum(B.prob)
# The frequency is then calculated under the assumption of an equal expected distribution among days, to which they should add to 350 which is the total amount of births counted.

```
```{r}
#Chi^2 Test of probabilities
chisq.test(births, p= expected.prob)
#This test will compare the observed vs. the expected probability of proportional births, and will tell us whether our hypothesis stands or not. 

#In this case, Chi^2 = 15.057, Alpha = 0.05, df = 6, CV = 12.59 
# Chi^2 > CV, THUS we can reject the Null hypothesis.

# Plotbox graph, comparing times until REM. Upon ANOVA and TUKEY TEST ANALYSIS, it was made evident that no group had a particular advantage in comparise to the rest, in terms of accelerating sleep descent into REM.

# Group A - showed no statistically significant reduction in 'Time until REM' than any of the groups aside from Group D (p<0.05).
# Group B - similarly, had no significantly different effect whatsoever to any of the other groups.
# Group C - differed most (p<0.05) from Group D (slowest acting drug v. other groups), but not the rest of the groups.
# Group D and E - showed no statistically significant difference whatsoever to any of the other groups (maybe to due to a wide range of results), though was close to approximating the rejection of the null hypothesis among each other (E V. D @ p=0.09 v. p<0.05).

#ANOVA & TUKEY INTERPRETATION: There was no significant difference among the drugs used in this trial, however the clinic had statistically significant influence (p<0.05) in determining its the rate at which sleeping aid medication helps achieve REM. Clinic 5 showed evidence of significant influence (p<0.05) on "Time until REM" vs. Clinic 1 and Clinic 3 (producing 'quicker acting sleep aid drugs'), however there was no evidence of any significance in comparison to other groups and from other groups among others.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

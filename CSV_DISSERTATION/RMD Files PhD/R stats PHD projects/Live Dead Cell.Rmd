This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
CellViabilityAssay
```


```{r}


av.zn5 <- ((CellViabilityAssay[1,3]+CellViabilityAssay[2,3])/2)
av.zn1 <- ((CellViabilityAssay[3,3]+CellViabilityAssay[4,3])/2)
av.zn5
av.zn1


ydead <- c(9.94152,10.13510,26.9663,11.5584,6.60377)
xdead <- c(1:5)
plot(xdead,ydead)
xd <- c("control","alginate","zno0.5","zno1","tio1")
xd2 <- as.double(xd)
anova(lm(ydead~xdead))
TukeyHSD(aov(CellViabilityAssay$Dead.Cells~CellViabilityAssay$Well))

chisq.test(CellViabilityAssay$Well,CellViabilityAssay$Dead.Cells)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Load the openPrimeR package
library(openPrimeR)

# Load example gene expression data
data(mtcars)

# Extract gene expression data and outcome variable
gene_expr <- as.matrix(mtcars[, 2:11])
outcome <- mtcars$am

# Perform PCR analysis with cross-validation
pcr_result <- PCR(gene_expr, outcome, cv = TRUE)

# View the results
summary(pcr_result)
plot(pcr_result)
```


```{r}
# Load the necessary packages
library(openPrimeR)
library(pls)

pcr

# Load example gene expression data
data(mtcars)

# Extract gene expression data and outcome variable
gene_expr <- as.matrix(mtcars[, 2:11])
outcome <- mtcars$am

# Perform PCR analysis with cross-validation
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
pcr_result <- pcr(gene_expr, outcome, scale = TRUE, validation = "CV")

# Convert pcr object to lm object
pcr_lm <- as.lm(pcr_result)

# View the results
validationplot(pcr_lm, legend.position = "bottomright")
```


```{r}
class(gene_expr)
class(outcome)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

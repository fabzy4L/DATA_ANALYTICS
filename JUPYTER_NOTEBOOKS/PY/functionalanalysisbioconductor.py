Creating an entire R project in this format might be challenging due to the complexity of the tools and data involved, but I can provide you with a simplified example of how you might structure such a project. This example won't involve actual mass spectrometry data or online tool integrations but will give you a basic idea of how to structure your project for learning purposes:

**Project Structure:**

1. **Project Root Directory**:
   - `Proteomics_Metabolomics_Project.Rproj`: R Project file for RStudio.
   - `README.md`: Project documentation.

2. **Data**:
   - `sample_mass_spectra.csv`: A sample CSV file containing mass spectrometry data.

3. **Scripts**:
   - `protein_identification.R`: Script to load and analyze mass spectrometry data using R packages.
   - `functional_analysis.R`: Script to perform gene ontology enrichment analysis using simulated data.
   - `metabolic_pathway_analysis.R`: Script to demonstrate metabolic pathway analysis using simulated data.

**Scripts:**

1. **protein_identification.R**:
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load and preprocess mass spectrometry data
mass_spectra <- read.csv("Data/sample_mass_spectra.csv")

# Perform protein identification analysis using Mascot or MaxQuant results
# (In reality, you would use the appropriate tools to load and analyze real data)
identified_proteins <- mass_spectra %>%
  filter(p_value < 0.05) %>%
  select(protein_id, gene_name)

# Display the identified proteins
print(identified_proteins)
```

2. **functional_analysis.R**:
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(GO.db)
library(topGO)

# Simulated data (replace with actual data)
identified_proteins <- read.csv("Data/identified_proteins.csv")

# Perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
# (In reality, you would use tools like clusterProfiler or enrichGO)
gene_universe <- unique(identified_proteins$gene_name)
gene_list <- identified_proteins$gene_name[1:100]  # Simulated gene list

# Define the ontology and perform enrichment analysis
GOdata <- new("topGOdata",
              ontology = "BP",
              allGenes = gene_universe,
              geneSel = gene_list,
              annot = annFUN.db,
              mapping = "org.Hs.eg.db")
result <- runTest(GOdata)
enriched_terms <- result$All[p.adjust(result$All$pval, method = "BH") < 0.05]

# Display enriched GO terms
print(enriched_terms)
```

3. **metabolic_pathway_analysis.R**:
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(MetaboAnalystR)

# Simulated data (replace with actual data)
metabolite_data <- read.csv("Data/metabolite_data.csv")
pathway_data <- read.csv("Data/pathway_data.csv")

# Perform metabolic pathway analysis using MetaboAnalystR
# (In reality, you would load and analyze real metabolomics data)
metabo_result <- MetaboAnalystR::runPathwayAnalysis(metabolite_data, pathway_data)

# Display pathway analysis results
print(metabo_result)
```

Remember that this is a simplified example for learning purposes. In practice, you would need actual mass spectrometry data and real tools like Mascot, MaxQuant, MetaboAnalyst, and others to perform these analyses. Additionally, this example doesn't cover data preprocessing, quality control, and other essential steps that are crucial in real-world analyses.

To set Python 3.7 as the language version for a specific directory where you intend to use Open Babel, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new virtual environment: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment. Then, run the following command to create a new virtual environment with Python 3.7:
   ```
   python3.7 -m venv myenv
   ```

   This will create a new directory named `myenv` (you can choose a different name) that contains the isolated Python environment.

2. Activate the virtual environment: Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   Once activated, your command prompt should show the name of the virtual environment.

3. Install Open Babel: With the virtual environment activated, you can use `pip` to install Open Babel. Run the following command to install the Open Babel package:
   ```
   pip install openbabel
   ```

   This will install Open Babel and any necessary dependencies within the virtual environment.

4. Use Open Babel: You can now use Open Babel within the virtual environment. Any Python scripts or commands you run will use the Python 3.7 version and have access to the Open Babel library.

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you want to work within that specific directory and use Python 3.7. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run the following command:
```
deactivate
```

Note that you'll need to repeat the activation step (`source myenv/bin/activate` or `myenv\Scripts\activate`) each time you open a new terminal or command prompt session to work within the virtual environment.

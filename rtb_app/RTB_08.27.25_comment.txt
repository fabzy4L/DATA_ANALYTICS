[08.27.25] Ship Dock Container Build

On 08.27.2025, Container Build output totaled 15384 units over 99.79 hours, averaging 154.16 UPH. This was above the 125 UPH threshold. However, 12 associates (35.3%) fell below standard. LC1 had 2 of 4 under, LC2 had 1 of 3 under, LC3 had 2 of 5 under, LC4 had 0 of 1 under, LC5 had 7 of 21 under. Performance issues are not isolated to new hires, with notable underperformance among LC4–LC5. Analysis indicates rate dilution from short-hour associates (bottom 25% by hours at ≤ 0.46 hours), accounting for approximately 41.7% of below-threshold cases. Recommended focus includes reinforcing pacing consistency, aligning work distribution to reduce dilution from short-hour associates, and targeted coaching for LC1, LC3 associates to stabilize overall performance.
